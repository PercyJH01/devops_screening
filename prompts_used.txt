Current State:

Cosmos DB (likely in provisioned RU or autoscale mode) holds 2M+ billing records.

Each record = ~300 KB, so total data size = hundreds of GB.

Read-heavy, but older than 3 months â†’ rarely accessed.

High storage + RU costs because Cosmos DB storage + RUs scale with size.

Goal: Reduce costs without breaking API contracts, losing data, or introducing downtime.
